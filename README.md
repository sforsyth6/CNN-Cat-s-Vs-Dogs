# CNN-Cats-Vs-Dogs
One of my first attempts at Convolutional Neural Networks which attempted to classify images of dogs and cats

The data repository used for my training can be found here on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data

The last test I performed gave me an accuracy of 80%, which can be improved with further tweaking of the hyper parameters
